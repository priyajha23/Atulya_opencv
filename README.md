The task was to detect squares and their colors and place aruco markers on them according to their particular id.

The image was converted to hsv and a color trackbar was used to detect the colors. The image of each color was saved and morphological opening was applied on them to remove noise so that they don't get detected in the contouring process. Contour of each color image was found and the squares in the was detected using approxPolyDP. minAreaRect() was used to find the width,height and rotation angle of squares. Then with the help of some simple trigonometry,corners of the upright square was found that contain the squares(this would later help while placing the aruco markers). Aruco ids of the 4 arucos was detected using functions from the aruco module. The angles of the arucos was also found using trigonometry. Next the aruco markers were resized and rotated by their own angle and angle of the squares to align them with squares. Then the aruco markers were placed on the squares using slicing and the coordinates of the upright bound squares were used. Now while placing the aruco markers,some other shapes got deformed due to aruco's white borders. This was corrected again by slicing and pasting the deformed parts from the original image.
